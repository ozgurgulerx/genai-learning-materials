## Overview
A curated collection of questions and hands-on practice materials for preparing for roles in Generative AI (GenAI), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository is designed to help candidates and learners strengthen their skills in:

- System design for GenAI and ML applications
- Coding and algorithmic problem-solving
- Theoretical foundations (ML, LLMs, and AI)
- Product thinking and real-world scenarios

## What's Included
- **Interview-style questions**: Covering technical, theoretical, and product-focused topics
- **Practice problems**: Coding challenges and system design exercises
- **Study guides**: Summaries and resources for key GenAI/ML/LLM concepts

## Repository Structure
```text
📁 genai-learning-materials/
└── questions/
    ├── 00–09_*   # Foundations (Transformer & LLM theory)
    ├── 10–19_*   # Training & Alignment (RLHF, DPO, etc.)
    ├── 20–29_*   # Reasoning & Retrieval (Reasoning models, RAG)
    ├── 30–39_*   # Tool / Agent Protocols (MCP, A2A)
    ├── 40–49_*   # Product & Strategy (GenAI product thinking)
    └── 50–59_*   # Safety & Security (AI safety, red-team)
```

### Naming Convention
Each filename begins with a two-digit prefix that groups related topics so they sort together naturally:

* **00–09 Foundations** – core Transformer & LLM theory
* **10–19 Training & Alignment** – RLHF, DPO …
* **20–29 Reasoning & Retrieval** – chain-of-thought, RAG
* **30–39 Tool / Agent Protocols** – MCP, Google A2A
* **40–49 Product & Strategy** – GenAI product thinking
* **50–59 Safety & Security** – model safety, red-teaming

Sparse numbering leaves room for future files (e.g., `23_rag_multimodal.md`) without renaming the rest.

> _Tip: Add your own topics and expand the structure as needed!_
