### Q1: What is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and why is it used in large language models?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags:** Concept, Alignment

**Sample Answer:**
RLHF is a three-stage training pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained language model using human preference signals.
1. **Supervised Instruction Tuning (SFT):** Start with a model like GPT-3, then fine-tune on curated instruction–response pairs.
2. **Reward Modeling (RM):** Collect human comparisons of model outputs (A vs. B). Train a reward model **Rθ(x,y)** with a binary cross-entropy loss to predict which output is preferred.
3. **RL Fine-Tuning:** Optimize the policy to maximize the reward model’s score while staying close to the SFT policy. This aligns generations with human preferences—e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness—without writing explicit rules.

### Q2: How is a reward model trained in RLHF, and what data is required for this stage?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Easy-Medium  
**Tags:** Reward Modeling, Data Collection

**Sample Answer:**
• **Data:** Prompt + *k* candidate responses, with human annotators choosing the best (or ranking).  
• **Architecture:** Usually the base LM with an added scalar head.  
• **Objective:** For a pair (y⁺, y⁻), maximize log σ(Rθ(y⁺) − Rθ(y⁻)).  
• **Regularization:** Dropout and label-smoothing; sometimes pairwise + listwise losses.  
• **Quality Control:** Use consensus, redundancy, and adversarial sampling to reduce noise.

---

### Q3: Explain the role of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in RLHF fine-tuning.

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** PPO, Policy Gradient

**Sample Answer:**
PPO maximizes expected reward while constraining the KL divergence to the reference policy:

E[ Rθ − β KL(πθ‖π₀) ].

• **Clipped Objective:** Limits the ratio **r=πθ/π₀** to [1 − ε, 1 + ε] to avoid large policy updates.  
• **Batch-On-Policy:** Collect trajectories by sampling continuations, compute advantages using the reward model, then perform a few SGD epochs.  
• **Stability:** Empirically more stable than vanilla policy gradient or TRPO at billion-parameter scale.

---

### Q4: How does RLHF differ from instruction-tuning with supervised learning?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Comparison, Supervised vs RL

**Sample Answer:**
Instruction tuning directly imitates *gold* answers, minimizing cross-entropy. RLHF instead optimizes a learned reward proxy, enabling:
• **Beyond Demonstrations:** The policy can discover novel responses not in human data.  
• **Preference Expression:** Human raters need only compare outputs, a lower-cost signal.  
• **Alignment Trade-off:** KL penalty balances exploration with staying truthful to pre-training knowledge.

### Q5: Describe common methods for gathering human preference data for RLHF.

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Data Collection, Human Preferences

**Sample Answer:**
1. **Pairwise Comparison (A/B):** Present two outputs, ask which is better. Simpler labeling, supports Bradley–Terry loss.
2. **Ranking (n-way):** Order *n* outputs; yields richer signal but higher cognitive load.
3. **Likert Scales:** Rate each output on attributes (helpful, harmless, etc.). Can be converted to pairwise comparisons.
4. **Active Learning:** Use disagreement or RM uncertainty to choose prompts that maximize information gain.
5. **Crowd vs Expert:** Mix crowd-sourced data for scale and expert reviews for safety-critical domains.

### Q6: Why is a KL-divergence penalty included during PPO fine-tuning, and how is it implemented?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard  
**Tags:** KL Penalty, Regularization

**Sample Answer:**
Without constraint, the policy can drift far from the pre-trained distribution, causing factual erosion or mode collapse. The KL term:

R′ = Rθ − β KL(πθ‖π₀)

acts as an adaptive *entropy regularizer*.
• **Implementation:** Compute token-level KL between logits of new policy and reference; add to reward.  
• **Tuning β:** Can be fixed or adjusted via PID controller to keep average KL near a target (e.g., 0.02 nats/token).

---

### Q7: What is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and how does it differ from PPO-based RLHF?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** DPO, Offline RLHF

**Sample Answer:**
DPO reframes preference learning as *classification* without explicit reward modeling or on-policy rollouts.
• **Loss:** For pair (y⁺, y⁻), minimize −log σ(Δ), where Δ = log πθ(y⁺) − log πθ(y⁻) − β.  
• **Offline:** Uses only static comparison data; no sampling during training, so it’s inexpensive.  
• **Pros:** Simpler pipeline, no reward model, deterministic training.  
• **Cons:** Relies heavily on data quality; may under-explore compared to PPO.

### Q8: What is reward hacking in RLHF, and how can it be mitigated?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Reward Hacking, Safety

**Sample Answer:**
Reward hacking occurs when the policy exploits weaknesses in the reward model—for example, inserting boilerplate that the RM strongly associates with high scores.

**Mitigations:**
1. **Adversarial Training:** Add hacked examples to the preference set.  
2. **Ensemble RMs:** Average multiple reward models to reduce over-fitting.  
3. **Periodic Human Review:** Sample rollouts for manual audit.  
4. **KL Budget:** Stronger constraint to prevent drastic distribution shift.

### Q9: Discuss the challenges of applying offline reinforcement learning techniques to RLHF.

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Offline RL, Dataset Shift

**Sample Answer:**
Offline RL trains on static data, but LLM action-spaces (token sequences) are huge:
• **Distribution Shift:** Behavior policy (SFT) differs from target; off-policy corrections (importance sampling) have high variance.  
• **Credit Assignment:** Preference labels are sequence-level; token-level advantage estimation is ambiguous.  
• **Exploration Deficit:** No new trajectories means policy may not discover higher-reward regions.
Methods like DPO or Q-learning with conservative penalties (CQL) attempt to address these issues but remain research-grade.

### Q10: What do current studies suggest about scaling the amount of human feedback versus model parameters in RLHF?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Scaling Laws, Data Efficiency

**Sample Answer:**
• **Chinchilla-like Trade-off:** Empirical results show reward model data should scale roughly logarithmically with model size.  
• **Diminishing Returns:** Beyond a few hundred thousand comparisons, marginal gains shrink for GPT-class models.  
• **Synthetic Feedback:** Self-play or LLM-generated critiques (RLAIF) can supplement human data cheaply.

### Q11: How does Constitutional AI extend or modify standard RLHF pipelines?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Constitutional AI, Alignment

**Sample Answer:**
Constitutional AI (Anthropic, 2023) replaces human preference collection with *constitutional principles* and AI self-critique.
1. Generate an initial answer.  
2. Have the model critique the answer against a constitution (e.g., honesty, harmlessness).  
3. Edit or regenerate until it satisfies principles.  
Finally, fine-tune on the (prompt, answer) pairs. This reduces human labor and provides consistent value alignment but depends on the quality of the constitution.

### Q12: Evaluate the limitations of RLHF in ensuring alignment and propose complementary techniques.

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Very Hard  
**Tags:** Safety, Alignment, Red-Teaming

**Sample Answer:**
**Limitations:**
• **Reward Model Fallibility:** Cannot capture all nuances of human values.  
• **Goodhart’s Law:** Optimizing a proxy can diverge from true intent.  
• **Cost & Bias:** Human preference data is expensive and culturally biased.  
• **Outer Alignment Only:** RLHF doesn’t address deceptive inner-alignment failures.

**Complementary Approaches:**
1. **RLAIF:** Use AI feedback to scale data.  
2. **Adversarial Red-Teaming:** Continuously probe the model for failures.  
3. **Debate & Iterated Amplification:** Pit models against each other to surface hidden flaws.  
4. **Mechanistic Interpretability:** Analyze internal circuits to detect deception.  
5. **Formal Verification:** Apply proofs or constraint solvers for bounded scenarios.

### Q13: What is Generalized Reinforcement Preference Optimization (GRPO) and how does it differ from PPO and DPO in RLHF pipelines?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** GRPO, Preference Optimization

**Sample Answer:**  
GRPO extends PPO by decoupling exploration and exploitation via a KL-regularized objective with an **adaptive** coefficient. Where PPO clips the policy ratio uniformly, GRPO scales the KL term according to reward-model uncertainty, allowing larger updates on flat reward landscapes and smaller steps near sharp gradients. Compared with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which forgoes RL and directly optimizes a logistic preference loss, GRPO retains on-policy rollouts yet achieves better sample efficiency and lower reward hacking.

---

### Q14: Write the mathematical objective of GRPO and explain the role of the adaptive KL term.

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Expert  
**Tags:** GRPO, KL Regularization

**Sample Answer:**  
For a prompt state *s* and action *a*:

$$\max_{\theta} \; \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\theta}} [ \hat{r}(a) ] 
- \beta_s \; \text{KL}\big( \pi_{\theta}(\cdot|s) \;||\; \pi_{\text{ref}}(\cdot|s) \big)$$

where $\hat{r}(a)$ is the reward-model score, $\pi_{\text{ref}}$ is the frozen SFT policy, and $\beta_s$ is **state-wise adaptive**:

$$\beta_s \leftarrow \beta_s \Big(1 + \alpha (\text{KL}_{\text{target}} - \text{KL}_s) \Big)$$

If observed KL is below target, $\beta_s$ shrinks → larger policy updates; if above, it grows → stronger penalty. This keeps global KL near target while adapting locally.

### Q15: What engineering challenges arise when scaling GRPO to billion-parameter LLMs?

**Category:** RLHF  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Scaling, Engineering

**Sample Answer:**  
1. **State-wise Statistics:** Tracking per-prompt KL needs memory; bucket prompts via hashing or exponential-moving average.  
2. **Reward Throughput:** GRPO queries reward model each rollout—serve reward model on FP8 GPUs with batching.  
3. **Stability:** Combine adaptive KL with conservative clipping early in training to avoid divergence.  
4. **Distributed Compute:** Use gradient accumulation + sequence parallelism to fit long rollouts.  
5. **Monitoring:** Track win-rate, reward scoring, and human eval to catch distribution drift introduced by adaptive updates.
