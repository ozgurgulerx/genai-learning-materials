# Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Question Candidates

Below are 10 Model Context Protocol questions *with detailed answers*, arranged from beginner to expert.

### Q1: What problem does the Model Context Protocol (MCP) aim to solve in AI tool integration?

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags:** Overview, Tool Integration

**Sample Answer:**
Modern LLM agents need to call external tools (search, code exec). Ad-hoc JSON schemas create fragmentation and security risks. MCP standardizes:
• **Discovery:** Agents know which tools exist and their signatures.
• **Validation:** Strict JSON-Schema typing prevents malformed calls.
• **Safety:** Built-in permission checks and gating stop unsafe actions.
Thus MCP provides a universal, secure handshake between models and heterogeneous back-end services.

### Q2: Explain the roles of namespaces and MCP servers in organizing tool functions.

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Easy-Medium  
**Tags:** Namespaces, Servers

**Sample Answer:**
• **Namespace:** A logical grouping (e.g., `filesystem`, `memory`) that prefixes tool names to avoid collisions (`memory.create_memory`).
• **MCP Server:** A network endpoint hosting one or more namespaces. Servers can be versioned (`memory@v1`) and require auth tokens.
Namespaces give hierarchical clarity inside the model; servers provide the transport and execution context.

### Q3: How are tool input and output schemas specified in MCP, and why is strict typing important?

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** JSON Schema, Typing

**Sample Answer:**
Each tool declaration embeds an OpenAPI/JSON-Schema object for `arguments` and `returns`.
Strict typing matters because:
1. **Parse Safety:** LLM output is validated before execution; malformed calls are rejected.
2. **IDE Autocomplete:** Clients can generate type-safe stubs.
3. **Version Diffing:** Schema diffs surface breaking changes.
MCP disallows `additionalProperties: true` by default to enforce explicitness.

### Q4: Describe the permissioning and safety checks MCP employs before executing potentially unsafe tool calls.

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard  
**Tags:** Security, Permissions

**Sample Answer:**
• **Capability Tokens:** Each agent process receives a scoped token listing allowed tool names.
• **Safety Flags:** Tool metadata marks operations as `unsafe`; human approval may be required.
• **Sandboxing:** File writes run in chrooted temp dirs; network calls limited by allowlist.
• **Rate & Budget Limits:** Prevent resource abuse.
A call passes through a policy engine that validates token scope + runtime context before dispatch.

### Q5: How does MCP handle asynchronous operations and return intermediate vs. final results?

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Async, Polling

**Sample Answer:**
If `blocking=false`, the server immediately returns a `call_id` and optional kickoff logs. The model can:
1. **Poll:** Invoke `check_status(call_id)` until `state==done`.
2. **Callback URL:** Provide a webhook for push notifications.
The separation lets long-running jobs (data crawl) continue without blocking token budgets.

### Q6: What is the purpose of the MCP memory server, and how does it support long-term agent context?

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Memory, Persistence

**Sample Answer:**
The memory server exposes CRUD tools (`create_memory`, `search_nodes`, etc.) over a graph store.
Agents write salient facts (user prefs, project feats) that outlive context windows. On new convo, a `search_nodes` call retrieves relevant memories, re-establishing continuity.
This enables personalization without oversaturating prompts.

---
### Q7: How does MCP communicate validation errors or execution failures back to the model?

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Errors, Resilience

**Sample Answer:**
Errors are returned as structured JSON with fields `type`, `message`, `retryable`, and optional `hint`.
• **ValidationError:** arguments do not match schema.
• **ExecutionError:** runtime exception inside tool.
Models can inspect `retryable` to decide on automatic retries or fallback logic.

---
### Q8: Discuss best practices for chaining multiple MCP tool calls to accomplish complex tasks efficiently.

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Tool Chaining, Planning

**Sample Answer:**
• **Plan First, Act Later:** Generate a high-level plan; keep tool count minimal.
• **Batch Where Possible:** Fetch multiple resources in one call to reduce latency.
• **Dependency Awareness:** Wait for prior call success before proceeding.
• **Caching:** Store intermediate results in memory server to avoid duplicate work.

---
### Q9: How can MCP ensure backward compatibility when tool signatures evolve?

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Versioning, Compatibility

**Sample Answer:**
• **Semantic Versioning:** `search@v2` introduced only additive args; breaking changes bump major.
• **Deprecation Window:** Older versions kept read-only for N weeks.
• **Adapter Layers:** Thin shims translate old calls to new schema when feasible.
This lets agent code roll forward gradually without 500s.

---
### Q10: What logging or tracing hooks does MCP provide for debugging agent-tool interactions at scale?

**Category:** MCP  
**Difficulty:** Very Hard  
**Tags:** Observability, Tracing

**Sample Answer:**
MCP instruments each call with an **OpenTelemetry** span containing:
• `tool_name`, `latency_ms`, `status`.
• Serialized arguments (PII-redacted) and truncated results.
Logs stream to a central collector where engineers join LLM tokens with tool traces to pinpoint latency or failure hot-spots.
