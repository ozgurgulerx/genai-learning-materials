## 1. Business Impact & KPIs

### Q1: Walk me through a customer engagement where you converted a GenAI PoC into measurable business KPIs. How did you pick the KPI and prove causality?

**Category:** Business Impact  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** KPI, Causality, ROI

**Sample Answer:**  
• **Context:** E-commerce client’s PoC for GenAI-generated product descriptions.  
• **KPI Selection:** Chose *add-to-cart rate* (ATC) over bounce rate because ATC is nearest to revenue and less confounded by marketing.  
• **Experiment:** 50/50 A/B on 10 000 SKUs for four weeks.  
• **Causality:** Used diff-in-diff with CUPED variance reduction; ATC uplift = +6.4 %, p < 0.01.  
• **Back-test:** Reverted copy on 5 % hold-out SKUs—uplift disappeared, strengthening causal claim.  
• **Outcome:** Incremental $3 M ARR; green-lit full rollout.

### Q2: A board member says, “GenAI is hype, show me the ROI in 90 days”. Outline your narrative and success metrics.

**Category:** Executive Communication  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** ROI, Narrative, Quick Win

**Sample Answer:**  
1. **Use-case selection:** Sales-email drafting—clear baseline cost, existing data.  
2. **90-day plan:** Week 1 data prep; Week 2 prompt tuning; Weeks 3-4 closed-beta; Weeks 5-8 full pilot; Weeks 9-12 KPI read-out.  
3. **Metrics:** SDR emails per hour (+3×), reply rate (+12 %), labor hours saved (-40 %), incremental pipeline value.  
4. **ROI Formula:** 
   \[(Labor $ + Pipeline $ × Conv) / Implementation Cost\]  
5. **Story:** “In 12 weeks we unlock $1.2 M productivity and $4 M pipeline for <$100 k spend—14× ROI and compounding.”

### Q3: Describe a situation where you had to **kill** a GenAI initiative. What data convinced you?

**Category:** Product Decision  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Sunset, Data-Driven

**Sample Answer:**  
News-app summarization widget increased session time but dropped ad CTR 9 %. Regression showed −$0.6 M ad revenue vs. +$0.1 M subscription gain. No feasible mitigation; phased out at beta. Documented findings → informed future long-form summarization efforts.

## 2. Technical Depth & Architectural Judgement

### Q4: Compare Retrieval-Augmented Generation, fine-tuning, and agents for a multilingual call-centre use-case on AWS. Which would you recommend first and why?

**Category:** Architecture  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** RAG, Fine-tune, Agents, Multilingual

**Sample Answer:**  
• **RAG (Bedrock + Kendra):** Fast, real-time grounding; supports 50+ languages via translated embeddings; low governance risk.  
• **Fine-tuning (SageMaker, LoRA):** Boosts tone/style but requires large labeled corpus per language; higher cost.  
• **Agents (Bedrock Agents + Lambda):** Automates workflows (refunds) but adds latency & complexity.  
**Recommendation:** Launch with RAG for quickest value and compliance; layer selective fine-tunes for high-volume languages; introduce agents for transactional flows once knowledge base proven.

### Q5: Latency suddenly triples in a production Bedrock pipeline using Guardrails and Anthropic Claude. Walk us through your triage plan.

**Category:** Operations  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Latency, Guardrails, Bedrock

**Sample Answer:**  
1. **Dashboards:** Check CloudWatch P90 spikes—identify stage.  
2. **Deploy Diff:** Verify guardrail or model version change.  
3. **Concurrency:** Inspect Provisioned-Throughput utilization; look for throttling.  
4. **Guardrail Logs:** If violation rate spiked, new regex may be pathological—profile pattern.  
5. **Regional Check:** Compare latency across regions to rule out infra issue.  
6. **Mitigation:** Temporarily disable enrichment causing +800 ms; open AWS Support with trace IDs.

### Q6: Explain how you’d design an evaluation loop (EvalOps) to cut hallucination rate across millions of daily requests.

**Category:** EvalOps  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Hallucination, Feedback Loop

**Sample Answer:**  
• **Sampling:** Importance-sample 0.1 % traffic weighted by rare intents.  
• **Detection:** LLM-as-Judge with search-grounded verifier.  
• **Label Store:** Feature store keyed by request hash, hallucination flag.  
• **Metric:** Weekly hallucination ≤0.5 % SLO with 95 % CI.  
• **CI Gate:** Block deploys if rate > baseline +0.1 %.  
• **Remediation:** Add failing examples to retrieval corpus or prompt tests; fine-tune reward model.

## 3. Programme & Stakeholder Orchestration

### Q7: You have **three weeks** to deliver an ideation workshop, roadmap, and exec read-out for a regulated bank. Outline your Gantt at the “one-pager” level.

**Category:** Program Mgmt  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Timeline, Banking

**Sample Answer:**  
• **Week 1:** Stakeholder interviews, data audit, pain-point mapping → 1-day design thinking workshop.  
• **Week 2:** Impact-feasibility scoring, 12-month roadmap, T-shirt sizing, compliance checklist.  
• **Week 3:** Business case, risk matrix, budget ask, final 15-slide exec deck.

---

### Q8: Tell us about a time you mediated between data-privacy/legal and engineering over model governance on AWS.

**Category:** Stakeholder  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Governance, Mediation

**Sample Answer:**  
Legal required on-prem PII redaction; engineering flagged latency risk. Facilitated risk workshop; agreed hybrid: client-side masking + Bedrock Guardrails + DPAs. Added 80 ms latency but within SLA; both teams signed off.

---

### Q9: How do you decide when to bring in Applied Scientists vs. Solutions Architects vs. Professional Services on a GenAI IC deal?

**Category:** Resource Planning  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Team Roles

**Sample Answer:**  
Matrix: **Novel research or custom reward** → Applied Scientist; **Reference architecture, security review** → SA; **Large-scale implementation/migration** → ProServe. Consider deal size, timeline, IP sensitivity.
