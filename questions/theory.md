### Q: What is the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning?

**Category:** Theory  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags:** ML Theory, Generalization, Overfitting

**Sample Answer:**
The bias-variance tradeoff describes the balance between a model's ability to fit training data (low bias) and its ability to generalize to new data (low variance). High bias can cause underfitting; high variance can cause overfitting.
