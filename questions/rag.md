### Q: What is HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) and how does it work?

**Category:** RAG  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Vector Search, ANN, Indexing

**Sample Answer:**
HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is an efficient algorithm and data structure for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional spaces. It is widely used in vector search engines and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to quickly find the most similar vectors (such as embeddings) to a given query vector.

HNSW builds a multi-layer, graph-based index where each node represents a data point and is connected to its nearest neighbors. The structure is hierarchical: upper layers are sparser and allow for fast, long-range navigation, while lower layers are denser for precise local search. During a search, the algorithm starts at the top layer and navigates down, using greedy search to find the closest nodes at each level. This approach combines the speed of graph traversal with high recall.

Some important points about HNSW:
- **Performance & Scalability:** HNSW provides an excellent trade-off between search speed and accuracy, making it suitable for very large datasets (millions of vectors).
- **Dynamic Updates:** HNSW supports efficient dynamic insertions and deletions, which is useful for real-world systems where data changes over time.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Key parameters like `M` (number of neighbors per node) and `ef` (search breadth) allow you to balance speed, memory usage, and recall. Increasing `ef` improves recall at the cost of slower queries.
- **Small-World Inspiration:** The algorithm is inspired by small-world networks, where most nodes can be reached from any other node in a small number of steps, enabling efficient navigation.
- **Memory Usage:** HNSW can use more memory than some other ANN methods because it stores multiple graph layers and neighbor lists, but this is often justified by its performance.

**Note:** In this context, "high recall" means that the algorithm is able to retrieve most of the true nearest neighbors for a given query, even though it is an approximate search method. High recall is important for ensuring relevant results in applications like RAG.
